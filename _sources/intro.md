# What is Datachef

Datachef is a python framework to enable "data extraction for humans", principally aimed at data sources using visual relatioships.

i.e, it allows you to quickly and easily transform something that looks like this:

![](./images/bands-before.png)

into something that looks like this:

![](./images/bands-after.png)

_Note: the above image was cropped short for practical reasons_.

Datachef provides a simple api suitable for **data analysts or people just beginning their journey with python** but is built to be _highly_ extensible as needed and can be configured to support even the most niche use cases and/or domain specific tabulated data sources.

To be clear - you 100% _can_ do virtually anything we're doing here with Pandas or `<insert your own preference>`, you cannot however do it anywhere near as quickly or easily

- To get a sense of what this looks like in practice, it's probably worth browsing the first few examples:
- To learn how to use Datachef just work through the `Basics` by the end of which you'll be able to write your first few extraction scripts and understand most of what you'll see in the examples.
- Once you've got the hand of that it's worth tackling `Intermediate` as well. After this you should be able to work through and understand all of the examples.
- The `Advanced` section is more aimed at the programmers and creating custom behaviour, though anyone that's done the first two sections should be able to tackle it with some patience.
