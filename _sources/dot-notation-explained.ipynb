    "# Extended Dot Notation\n",
    "\n",
    "Datachef makes heavy use of **extended dot notation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simplest terms think of this as \"constantly chaining commands together with lots of .'s\".\n",
    "\n",
    "i.e\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "data_is_tidy = data_is_messy.so_clean_it_up().then_format_it().then_we_are_done()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a powerful and fairly intuitive approach for data wrangling as the majority of IDE's have auto completion so a user can easily browse through the availible tools for a given context/class rather than having to memorize commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given this approach may be a new thing for those nearer the start of their journey with python this section briefly explains the concept."
