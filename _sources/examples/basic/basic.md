# Basic Examples

The examples in this section use tools and techniques are detailed in the [basics](https://mikeadamss.github.io/datachef/basics.html) section of this documentation.

Examples will vary in complexity but is you've worked through Chapter 1 then you have everything you need to understand all the examples here with a little study.

## Data Disclaimer

Precisely how to correctly extract, dimension and categorise extracted data is an art all of its own and _very dependent on domain expertise_ and _very subject to contrary opinions_, as such I'm not even going to try and make no claims whatsoever as to whether or to what extent any of the examples are "correctly" represented after extraction from their original sources.

To put it another way these are purely examples of **how** to extract data with code, the correct/best/ideal structure and categorisation for any and all examples I leave to others to debate as it has no bearing on our goal of teaching people how to use these tools.
