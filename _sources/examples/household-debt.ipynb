    "With these example tutorials I'm going to comment heavily and cover nuances in a follow up section (with liberal targetted previews as needed) as it's the easiest way to grapple with new ideas. It may also be worth opening up these notebooks yourself (they're in `./jupyterbook` in the [tidychef](https://github.com/mikeAdamss/tidychef) github repo) so you can run, alter and generally have a play about with this yourself as part of your learning.\n",
