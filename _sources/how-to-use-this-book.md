# How to use this book

This book is organised in a very deliberate fashion to help onboard people to this technology and get them productive in the minimum amount of time and can largely be tackled in sequence.

That said, there are some nuances depending on your skillset and goals which I'll try to touch on.


- If you're anything less than an experienced python developer then **do** read the section on [extended dot notation](https://mikeadamss.github.io/datachef/dot-notation-explained.html), it will make everything else considerably easier to understand.

- If you want to get a quick idea of what datachef does, look at the first few recipes in [basic examples](https://mikeadamss.github.io/datachef/examples/basic/basic.html) section before coming back here.

- To learn datachef, start with the basics and work through that chapter. **[Chapter 1: Basics](https://mikeadamss.github.io/datachef/basics.html) and the [basic examples](https://mikeadamss.github.io/datachef/examples/basic/basic.html) are complementary** wth the example limited to and highlighted those things covered in the documentation. Once you're absorbed the documentation you should be able to understand the examples (hands on learners may attempt it the other way around and it may well work, though that's not the way it was written).

Once you've done this you'll be able to read and understand a large number of recipes and have a solid grasp of this package and its api. This should be all you need to become productive with datachef.

- Like Chapter 1, **[Chapter 2: Intermediate](https://mikeadamss.github.io/datachef/intermediate.html) and the [intermediate examples](https://mikeadamss.github.io/datachef/examples/intermediate/intermediate.html) are also complementary** and completing the former should allow you to understand the latter.

- The [advanced](https://mikeadamss.github.io/datachef/advanced.html) section is a more developer-esque section (thought it should be within reach of an experienced datachef user as well) so should be considered optional. There are some useful things there and you probably _should_ tackle it (and its examples) it using datachef regularly, but you can be firmly up and running for a while and even producing reliable repeatable data pipelines before tackling this content.

- The [techical reference](https://mikeadamss.github.io/datachef/technical.html) section is purely for the programmers amongst you.
