It may also be worth opening up these notebooks yourself (they're in `./jupyterbook` in the [tidychef](https://github.com/mikeAdamss/tidychef) github repo) so you can run, alter and generally have a play about with this yourself as part of your learning.\n",

    "_Note - these tutorial scripts might seem verbose due all the comments but that's ok (this is a tutorial after all). If you take them out you end up with a fairly succinct and human readable encapsulation of what would otherwise (with existing tools) be a rather convoluted and fragile set of instructions to express._\n",
