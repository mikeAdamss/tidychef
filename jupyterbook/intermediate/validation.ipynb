    "- The `<selectable>.validate()` method run against **selections** so police your _extraction logic_.\n",
    "- Validations via the `Column(validate=)` keyword runs against the **output** so police your _final product_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1.) You want to select an \"anchor cell\" or a selection of cells for the sole purpose of subtracting it from another selection. It could be important to confirm these selections are accurate but because they're not directly extracted values then `validate=` will never see them (just the consequence of them) so the `<selectable>.validate()` is more appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 2.) You're are using `apply=` to cleanse cell value data _at the point of extraction_ and need to make sure the correct things are happening, the `<selectable>.validate()` method will **never see these cleansed values**, but `validate=` will.\n",
