# How to Use This Book

This guide is structured to get you productive with TidyChef as quickly as possible. You don’t need to read everything before trying it—start experimenting early.

## Quick Start

- Begin with **[Chapter 1: Basics](https://mikeadamss.github.io/tidychef/basics.html)**. This introduces TidyChef’s core concepts and how to apply them.

- Then move to the **[Examples](https://mikeadamss.github.io/tidychef/examples.html)**. These are presented in _roughly_ increasing order of complexity.

  You don’t need to finish all the documentation before trying the examples. Feel free to switch back and forth between the two—most users find it helpful to read a bit, try an example, and return for clarification as needed. They're designed to support each other.

## Next Steps

- Once you’re comfortable with the basics, continue to **[Chapter 2: Intermediate](https://mikeadamss.github.io/tidychef/intermediate.html)**. It introduces more advanced techniques to  deals with messier real-world data. The same example list continues to be relevant here—later entries often reflect intermediate concepts.

- **[Chapter 3: Advanced](https://mikeadamss.github.io/tidychef/advanced.html)** is for those extending TidyChef or integrating it into broader tooling. This is optional, but useful for power users and developers.

- The **[Technical Reference](https://mikeadamss.github.io/tidychef/technical.html)** is a granular API guide, intended for developers.

## Note:

### Excel references

Regardless of the format in question tidychef often makes heavy use of the phrase "excel reference" or more commonly `excel_ref()`.

This is **nothing** to do with excel or even spreadsheets, it's simply a matter of practicality.

If you say "excel reference C3" the vast majority of people will know what you are talking about. If you say "x offset 2, y offset 4" you've just lost half the audience.


### Extensibility

TidyChef is designed as an extensible framework. While its core features cover most common needs, it’s built to be easily extended—whether to support new data formats, alternate acquisition methods, custom selection logic, or domain-specific validation. Extensions can be added seamlessly and are fully documented, allowing users to adapt the tool to their specific workflows.
