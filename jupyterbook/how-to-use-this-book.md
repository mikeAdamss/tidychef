# How To Use This Book

This book is organised in a very deliberate fashion to help onboard people to this technology and get them productive in the minimum amount of time and can largely be tackled in sequence.

That said, there are some nuances depending on your skillset and goals which I'll try to touch on.

- The sections on [extensibility](https://mikeadamss.github.io/datachef/extensibility.html) and [quirks](https://mikeadamss.github.io/datachef/quirks.html) are short pages of prose containing supplementary information. There are some useful insights into datachefs goals and approach here but you can come back to these as needed.

- If you want to get a quick idea of what datachef does, look at the first few recipes in [basic examples](https://mikeadamss.github.io/datachef/examples/basic/basic.html) section before coming back here.

- To learn datachef, start with [Chapter 1: Basics](https://mikeadamss.github.io/datachef/basics.html). Note - this chapter and the [basic examples](https://mikeadamss.github.io/datachef/examples/basic/basic.html) are complementary, with the examples limited to and highlighted those things covered in the documentation. Once you're absorbed this you should be able to understand the examples (hands on learners may attempt it the other way around and it may well work, though that's not the way it was written).

Once you've done this you'll be able to read and understand a large number of recipes and have a solid grasp of this package and its api. This should be all you need to get up and running with datachef.

- Like Chapter 1, [Chapter 2: Intermediate](https://mikeadamss.github.io/datachef/intermediate.html) and the [intermediate examples](https://mikeadamss.github.io/datachef/examples/intermediate/intermediate.html) are also complementary and completing the former should explain anything new you'll encounter in the examples. Be aware though, while the examples for this section use mostly the tools from basic its **against much more complex and messy data sources**. It's probably wise to take some time and practice what you learnt in [Chapter 1: Basics](https://mikeadamss.github.io/datachef/basics.html) against some data sources of your own before tackling these in earnest.

I'd consider the above section the final part of the onboarding to full capability with datachef. After that it's just practice.

- The [Chapter 3: Advanced](https://mikeadamss.github.io/datachef/advanced.html) is a more developer-esque section (thought it should be within reach of an experienced datachef user as well) so should be considered optional. There are some useful things here and you probably _should_ tackle this if you're looking into extending datachef. You can however be firmly up and running for a while and even producing reliable repeatable data pipelines without tackling this content.

- The [Chapter 4: Examples](https://mikeadamss.github.io/datachef/technical.html) section holds all examples recipes and should be tackled alongside the other chapters as detailed above. It does also include some additional **examples of other examples recipes with added validation**. While validation is of importance to anyone setting up a repeatable ETL process, for others (such as those doing ad hoc or one of analysis) the significance can vary. This chapter is intended to be extended over time and interested users are encouraged to PR their own examples at the datachef repository.

- The [Chapter 5: Technical Reference](https://mikeadamss.github.io/datachef/technical.html) section is purely for the programmers.
