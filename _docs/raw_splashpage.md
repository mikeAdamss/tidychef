## installation

Datachef can be installed from pypi via 

```
pip install datachef
```

_note: not true (yet) at time of writing_.

You can run datacheck via any python interpreter you want to, but the examples and documentation will tend to use Jupyter notebooks/labs/books as its html features work particularly well for examples.

## users vs developers

Regardless of which category you fall into, its advisable to start your interactions with datachef via the scenarios (see next section).

If you are looking for development and/or technical information - in addition to the API documentation (see "Submodules" in the left hand menu) the [datachef github repo](https://github.com/mikeAdamss/datachef) also contains details on design choices, guidelines for contributing and an explanation of how datachef can be extended and customised. 

## scenarios explained

Scenarios are Jupyter notebook examples used for both regression testing and as examples for onboarding new users.

Scenarios are organised numerically with the ordering roughly equating to the learning curve for a new user.

Scenarios are also rated as "basic", "intermediate" and "advanced" so you can look ahead for further examples and guidance on a given topic.

A fourth category of "examples" follows in its own discrete section. These are full working examples using messy opendata sources from the web.

## scenarios...

If you want to run these scenarios interactively, you can download a zip file of all scenarios as `.ipynb` -
